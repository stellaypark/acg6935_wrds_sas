	1. 	Some variables in Funda are 'header' (that means, all firms' rows get updated if the value changes)
		Verify if variable 'CIK' (central index key) changes over time or not (if it doesn't change, it means it is a header variable)

	2. 	For each firm (with non-missing assets, sales and equity) count the number of years of data before prcc_f is non-missing
		(For example, if a firm is added to Funda in 2004, and prcc_f only is available for the first time in 2006, then there are 2 years of data for that firm)
